# Frontend assessment

# WeatherApp
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.0.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

## Short description
Develop a simple frontend application using best practices that calculates the average temperature forecast of a city. The goals are to learn something new and as a result have a nice addition to your portfolio.

The design is located here: https://www.figma.com/file/xIxopUIRlqiWndWbyZJkM2/Weather-app?node-id=6%3A0&t=MAaHD7nR2HWrdb9p-1

## Features
- Follow the provided design. On top you will have the input, on the bottom the results with live reload.
- A user should be able to enter the name of a city and a 2-letter country code. The application will lookup the weather forecast of that city.
- The application then averages the forecasted temperature of the next 10 days.
- It also displays the temperature for the next 7 days with the day (Monday - Sunday) and the corresponding temperature.
- Also the background has a gradient where the end point is the color attached to the average temperature on the next 10 days.

We prefer that you use Angular for this assignment. It is okay to use other frameworks, let us know if you do.

It is important for us that you show what your code looks like and how you structure a project; what do you think are best practices? How would you store the weather data if your application would scale to a bigger application?

We recommend using the Weatherbit API with a free account.

Give us a signal when you are ready.
